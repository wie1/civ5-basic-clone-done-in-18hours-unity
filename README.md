# civ5-basic-clone-done-in-18hours-unity
code is propably bad but maybe someone will enjoy

CIVILIZATION.zip (not civ.zip, i dont know how to delete it) contains the whole unity file, just open scene.scene and it should work, if not then try to somehow contact me, i'm totally new to github so i might have gotten it wrong
